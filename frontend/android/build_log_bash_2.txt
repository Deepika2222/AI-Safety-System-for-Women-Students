WARNING: The specified Android SDK Build Tools version (34.0.0) is ignored, as it is below the minimum supported version (35.0.0) for Android Gradle Plugin 8.12.0.
Android SDK Build Tools 35.0.0 will be used.
To suppress this warning, remove "buildToolsVersion '34.0.0'" from your build.gradle file, as each version of the Android Gradle Plugin now has a default version of the build tools.

[Incubating] Problems report is available at: file:///D:/Projects/Protego/frontend/android/build/reports/problems/problems-report.html

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem was found with the configuration of task ':app:generateAutolinkingNewArchitectureFiles' (type 'GenerateAutolinkingNewArchitecturesFileTask').
  - In plugin 'com.facebook.react' type 'com.facebook.react.tasks.GenerateAutolinkingNewArchitecturesFileTask' property 'autolinkInputFile' specifies file 'D:\Projects\Protego\frontend\android\build\generated\autolinking\autolinking.json' which doesn't exist.
    
    Reason: An input file was expected to be present but it doesn't exist.
    
    Possible solutions:
      1. Make sure the file exists before the task is called.
      2. Make sure that the task which produces the file is declared as an input.
    
    For more information, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.13/userguide/validation_problems.html#input_file_does_not_exist in the Gradle documentation.

* Try:
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
> Run with --scan to get full insights.
